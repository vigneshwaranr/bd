#### Description

**Installation**

***For Debian/Ubuntu***

Packages available here:

https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bd

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bd



***For other OS***

```shell
wget --no-check-certificate -O /usr/local/bin/bd https://raw.github.com/vigneshwaranr/bd/master/bd
chmod +rx /usr/local/bin/bd
echo 'alias bd=". bd -si"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# If you need autocomplete support, follow these two steps
wget -O /etc/bash_completion.d/bd https://raw.github.com/vigneshwaranr/bd/master/bash_completion.d/bd
source /etc/bash_completion.d/bd
```

To enable case-sensitive directory name matching, use `-s` instead of `-si` in the alias.

**How to use:**

If you are in this path `/home/user/project/src/org/main/site/utils/file/reader/whatever`
and you want to go to `site` directory quickly, 

then just type:
     <s>`bd site`</></include.diagnostic.synopsis>

In fact, You can simply type <code>bd *\<starting few letters\>*</code> like `bd s` or `bd si`

If there are more than one directories with same name up in the hierarchy, bd will take you to the closest. (Not considering the immediate parent.)

---

**Other uses:**

Using bd within backticks (<code>\`bd \<letter(s)\>\`</code>) prints out the path without changing the current directory.

You can take advantage of that by combining <code>\`bd \<letter(s)\>\`</code> with other commands such as ls, ln, echo, zip, tar etc..

**Example:**

1. If you just want to list the contents of a parent directory,
   without going there, then you can use:
		<code>ls \`bd p\`</code>
   in the given example, it will list the contents of 
             `/home/user/project/`

2. If you want to execute a file somewhere in a parent directory,
            <code>\`bd p\`/build.sh</code>
   will execute `/home/user/project/build.sh` while not changing the
   current directory.

3. If you reside in `/home/user/project/src/org/main/site/utils/file/reader/whatever`
   and want to change to `/home/user/project/test`, then try
            <code>cd \`bd p\`/test</code>
